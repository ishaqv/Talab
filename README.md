# Talab - a journey of seeking clarity in Islam

Talab means seeking.

This repository is a personal journey to understand Islam as it was revealed —
through the Qur’an, the authentic Sunnah, and sound reasoning —
without blindly inheriting cultural practices, assumptions, or fear-based beliefs.

The goal is not to challenge Allah or His Messenger,
but to avoid attributing to them what they did not say.

This is written first for clarity, then for teaching — especially to the next generation.

Conclusions here are tentative, evidence-based, and open to revision.
