## 🌟 Hello, my little friend

Have you ever looked at the sky
and wondered who made the stars?

Have you ever felt happy…
or sad…
or scared…
and wished someone was listening?

Someone **is** listening.

His name is **Allah**.

---

## 🌍 Once upon a time…

Before there were people,
before toys, houses, or schools…

Allah was already there.

Allah made:

* the sky 🌤️
* the sun ☀️
* the moon 🌙
* animals 🐦🐘
* trees 🌳
* **and YOU** 💖

Allah made everything with care.

Nothing was an accident.



## 💖 Allah is VERY kind

The most important thing to know about Allah is this:

> **Allah is kind. Very kind.**

Allah loves to:

* forgive
* help
* give chances
* listen

Allah is kinder than:

* your parents
* your teachers
* anyone in the whole world

Even when you make mistakes,
Allah does **not** stop loving you.



## 🫶 Allah is close to you

Allah is not far away.

Allah:

* hears you when you talk
* knows when you feel happy
* knows when you feel sad
* understands your heart

You don’t need special words.

You can talk to Allah:

* in your room
* before sleeping
* when you are scared
* when you are thankful

Allah is always listening 🌙


## 🌈 Why Allah made you

Allah made you because:

* He wanted to care for you
* He wanted to teach you
* He wanted you to grow into a good person

Allah does **not** need anything from you.

But He loves when you:

* are honest
* are kind
* try again when you fail

Trying matters 💫



## 🤍 Loving Allah

We love Allah because:

* He protects us
* He forgives us
* He never leaves us
* He always wants good for us

Loving Allah means:

* being gentle
* telling the truth
* saying sorry
* helping others



## 🌱 A small reminder

Allah is **not scary**.

Allah is **fair**.

Fair means:

* good things matter
* mistakes can be fixed
* learning takes time

Allah wants you to succeed 🌟


## 🌙 We will learn more later

As you grow,
you will learn more about:

* rules
* choices
* right and wrong

But today, remember this:

> **Allah loves you.
> Allah hears you.
> Allah wants good for you.**
